"""Byte-for-byte snapshot test against microsoft/azure-skills.

The snapshot in ``tests/fixtures/azure-skills/`` was captured from
microsoft/azure-skills@bef1f05. This test asserts that running
``apm pack`` on the captured ``apm.yml`` produces a marketplace.json
whose SHA-256 matches the one shipped in that repo.

Marker: ``integration`` so it can be excluded from quick unit runs.
