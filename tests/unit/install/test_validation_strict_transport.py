"""Tests for strict-by-default transport selection in install.validation.

Regression: ``apm install https://corp-bitbucket.example/...`` used to fall
back to SSH on port 22 when the HTTPS probe failed, masking the real HTTPS
failure (auth/redirect) behind a 30s SSH timeout (issue microsoft/apm#992).
After the fix, an explicit ``http://`` / ``https://`` / ``ssh://`` URL on a
generic host probes ONLY that transport unless ``APM_ALLOW_PROTOCOL_FALLBACK=1``
re-enables the legacy permissive chain (mirroring ``_clone_with_fallback``).
