class TestPackHybridDescriptionWarning:
    """pack_bundle warns when a HYBRID package is missing apm.yml.description.

    HYBRID layout = apm.yml + SKILL.md at project root (no `.apm/`).
    apm.yml.description and SKILL.md description are independent fields
    with different consumers (CLI/search vs. agent invocation matcher).
    A package can pack and ship without apm.yml.description, but its
    `apm view` / `apm search` / marketplace listing will degrade to
    "(no description)" while Claude/Copilot still invoke the skill
    correctly. The pack-time warning catches this for the AUTHOR -- the
    only actor who can fix it -- without forcing every CONSUMER to see
    noise on `apm install`.
