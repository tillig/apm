In about ten minutes you will scaffold an APM package, add a skill that
auto-activates inside Copilot or Claude, add a custom agent that pairs with
it, install both into a project, and ship the result as a plugin. No prompts,
no `cat <<EOF`, no compile step you do not need.

If you want the conceptual map first, read [Anatomy of an APM Package](../../introduction/anatomy-of-an-apm-package/).
Otherwise, start here.

## Prerequisites

- APM installed -- see [Installation](/apm/getting-started/installation/).
- A GitHub account and an empty repo for publishing (step 5).
- A runtime where you can try the result: GitHub Copilot, Claude Code, or
  Cursor.

## 1. Scaffold

```bash
apm init -y team-skills
cd team-skills
```

`apm init` creates exactly one file -- the manifest. The `.apm/` source tree
is yours to author.

```
team-skills/
+-- apm.yml
```

Open `apm.yml` and give it a real description. The rest of the manifest is
already correct:

**`apm.yml`**

```yaml
name: team-skills
version: 1.0.0
description: Skills and agents for our team's review workflow
author: your-handle
dependencies:
  apm: []
  mcp: []
scripts: {}
```

## 2. Add a skill

A **skill** is a chunk of expertise that the runtime activates automatically
based on its `description`. No slash command, no manual selection: the agent
sees the description, decides the skill is relevant, and pulls it in. That
auto-activation is what separates skills from prompts.

Create one for drafting pull-request descriptions:

**`.apm/skills/pr-description/SKILL.md`**

```markdown
---
name: pr-description
description: >-
  Activate when the user asks for a pull-request description, a summary of
  uncommitted changes, or release notes. Use when preparing to open a PR or
  when the user says "draft a PR description for me".
---
# PR Description Skill

Produce a PR description with these sections, in order:

## Summary

One sentence. What changes and why. No file lists, no implementation detail.

## Motivation

Two to four sentences. The problem this solves or the capability it adds.
Link to the issue or design doc if one exists.

## Changes

Bullet list grouped by area (e.g. "API", "Tests", "Docs"). One bullet per
logical change, not per file.

## Risk and rollback

Note any breaking changes, migrations required, or feature flags.
Mention how to revert if something breaks.

## Testing

How you verified the change. Commands run, environments tested.
```

The frontmatter `description` is a contract with the runtime: write it as
"activate when ...". The body is the operating manual the agent reads when
the skill fires.

> Want to inspect a real one? The skill that governs this CLI's own
> architecture decisions lives at
> [`.apm/skills/python-architecture/SKILL.md`](https://github.com/microsoft/apm/blob/main/.apm/skills/python-architecture/SKILL.md)
> in this repo. Same shape, different concern.

See the [Skills guide](/apm/guides/skills/) for the full schema.

## 3. Add a custom agent

A **custom agent** (`.agent.md`) is a named expert your runtime can invoke
directly. While skills auto-activate based on context, agents are summoned
on demand -- typically with `@agent-name`.

Pair the skill with a reviewer agent that critiques the diff before the PR
goes out:

**`.apm/agents/team-reviewer.agent.md`**

```markdown
---
name: team-reviewer
description: Senior reviewer that critiques diffs against team standards before PR submission.
---
# Team Reviewer

You are a senior engineer reviewing a teammate's diff before it becomes
a pull request. Your job is to catch the things that waste reviewer
time downstream.

## What to check, in order

1. **Correctness.** Does the code do what its commit message claims?
   Spot logic errors, off-by-ones, unhandled error paths.
2. **Tests.** Are the changed code paths covered? Are new public APIs
   exercised by at least one test? Flag missing coverage explicitly.
3. **Naming and clarity.** Are names accurate? Would a new contributor
   understand this in six months?
4. **Surface area.** Does this change export anything new? If yes, is
   that intentional and documented?

## Output format

Group findings by severity: **Blocking**, **Should fix**, **Nit**.
For each finding, cite the file and line. End with a one-line verdict:
"Ready to ship", "Address blockers then ship", or "Needs another pass".

Do not rewrite the code yourself. Point and explain.
```

> A real example: this repo's documentation agent lives at
> [`.apm/agents/doc-writer.agent.md`](https://github.com/microsoft/apm/blob/main/.apm/agents/doc-writer.agent.md).

See the [Agent Workflows guide](/apm/guides/agent-workflows/) for more.

## 4. Deploy and use

Run install with no arguments. APM treats your repo as the package and
deploys its `.apm/` content into the runtime directories your tools read:

```bash
apm install
```

Output:

```
[+] <project root> (local)
|-- 1 agent integrated -> .github/agents/
|-- 1 skill(s) integrated -> .github/skills/
[i] Added apm_modules/ to .gitignore
```

Your tree now has source on the left and runtime-ready output on the right:

```
team-skills/
+-- .apm/                              # source you edit
|   +-- skills/
|   |   +-- pr-description/SKILL.md
|   +-- agents/
|       +-- team-reviewer.agent.md
+-- .github/                           # generated by apm install
|   +-- skills/
|   |   +-- pr-description/SKILL.md
|   +-- agents/
|       +-- team-reviewer.agent.md
+-- apm.yml
+-- apm.lock.yaml
```

`apm install` auto-detects which runtimes you have. The example above shows
`.github/` because Copilot is the default fallback. If `.claude/`, `.cursor/`,
`.opencode/`, or `.gemini/` exists in the project, they get populated too. To target
explicitly, see the [Compilation guide](/apm/guides/compilation/).

> **What about `apm compile`?** Compile is a different concern: it
> generates merged `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` / `GEMINI.md` files for tools
> that read a top-level context document for instructions (Codex, Gemini,
> plain `agents`-protocol hosts). Gemini also receives commands, skills,
> hooks, and MCP via `apm install`. Copilot, Claude Code, and Cursor read
> the per-skill directories directly -- no compile step needed.

Now open Copilot or Claude in this project. Ask "draft a PR description for
my last commit". The `pr-description` skill activates on its own. To get the
review pass, type `@team-reviewer review my staged changes`.

## 5. Publish as a package

Push to GitHub:

```bash
git init
git add apm.yml .apm/
git commit -m "Initial team-skills package"
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-handle/team-skills.git
git push -u origin main
```

In any other project's `apm.yml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  apm:
    - your-handle/team-skills
```

Then `apm install` -- consumers get the same skill and agent in their
runtime dirs, with version pinning recorded in `apm.lock.yaml`.

For a real published package to read, see
[`microsoft/apm-sample-package`](https://github.com/microsoft/apm-sample-package)
(install with `apm install microsoft/apm-sample-package#v1.0.0`).

## 6. Ship as a plugin (optional)

The same package can ship as a standalone plugin -- no APM required for
consumers. This lets you target plugin-aware hosts (Copilot CLI plugins,
the broader plugin ecosystem) with the primitives you already authored.

```bash
apm pack
```

Output (plugin format is the default):

```
build/team-skills-1.0.0/
+-- plugin.json        # synthesized, schema-conformant per https://json.schemastore.org/claude-code-plugin.json
+-- agents/
|   +-- team-reviewer.agent.md
+-- skills/
    +-- pr-description/SKILL.md
```

No `apm.yml`, no `apm_modules/`, no `.apm/`. Just primitives in
plugin-native layout. Convention dirs (`agents/`, `skills/`, `commands/`,
`instructions/`) are auto-discovered by Claude Code, so the synthesized
`plugin.json` does not list them.

If you know up front that you want to ship a plugin, you can scaffold with
`apm init --plugin team-skills`, which adds `plugin.json` next to `apm.yml`
from day one. APM still gives you dependency management, the lockfile, and
audit while you author; pack produces the plugin bundle when you ship.

For the full reference, see the [Pack & Distribute guide](/apm/guides/pack-distribute/)
and the [Plugin authoring guide](/apm/guides/plugins/).

## Choosing a package layout

APM recognizes three layouts. Pick the one that matches what you are shipping:

- **One skill** -- put `SKILL.md` at the repo root, with optional
  `agents/`, `assets/`, or `scripts/` directories alongside it. Add
  `apm.yml` if you need dependency management (this is a HYBRID package).
  APM installs the whole directory as a single skill bundle.

- **Multiple primitives** -- use the `.apm/` directory with `skills/`,
  `agents/`, `instructions/` subdirectories (the layout used in this guide).
  APM hoists each primitive into the consumer's runtime dirs individually.

- **Claude plugin** -- if you already have a `plugin.json`, APM can consume
  it directly without restructuring.

For the full comparison and metadata precedence rules, see
[Package Types](../../reference/package-types/).
