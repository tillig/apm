Marketplaces are curated indexes of plugins hosted as GitHub repositories. Each marketplace contains a `marketplace.json` file that maps plugin names to source locations. APM resolves these entries to Git URLs, so plugins installed from marketplaces get the same version locking, security scanning, and governance as any other APM dependency.

## How marketplaces work

A marketplace is a GitHub repository with a `marketplace.json` at its root. The file lists plugins with their source type and location:

```json
{
  "name": "Acme Plugins",
  "plugins": [
    {
      "name": "code-review",
      "description": "Automated code review agent",
      "source": { "type": "github", "repo": "acme/code-review-plugin" }
    },
    {
      "name": "style-guide",
      "source": { "type": "url", "url": "https://github.com/acme/style-guide.git" }
    },
    {
      "name": "eslint-rules",
      "source": { "type": "git-subdir", "repo": "acme/monorepo", "subdir": "plugins/eslint-rules" }
    },
    {
      "name": "local-tools",
      "source": "./tools/local-plugin"
    }
  ]
}
```

Both Copilot CLI and Claude Code `marketplace.json` formats are supported. Copilot CLI uses `"repository"` and `"ref"` fields; Claude Code uses `"source"` (string or object). APM normalizes entries from either format into its canonical dependency representation.

### Supported source types

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `github` | GitHub `owner/repo` shorthand | `acme/code-review-plugin` |
| `url` | Full HTTPS or SSH Git URL | `https://github.com/acme/style-guide.git` |
| `git-subdir` | Subdirectory within a Git repository (`repo` + `subdir`) | `acme/monorepo` + `plugins/eslint-rules` |
| String `source` | Subdirectory within the marketplace repository itself | `./tools/local-plugin` |

npm sources are not supported. Copilot CLI format uses `"repository"` and optional `"ref"` fields instead of `"source"`.

### Plugin root directory

Marketplaces can declare a `metadata.pluginRoot` field to specify the base directory for bare-name sources:

```json
{
  "metadata": { "pluginRoot": "./plugins" },
  "plugins": [
    { "name": "my-tool", "source": "my-tool" }
  ]
}
```

With `pluginRoot` set to `./plugins`, the source `"my-tool"` resolves to `owner/repo/plugins/my-tool`. Sources that already contain a path separator (e.g. `./custom/path`) are not affected by `pluginRoot`.

### Versioned plugins

Plugins can declare a `version` field and a `source.ref` that points to a specific Git tag or commit:

```json
{
  "name": "code-review",
  "description": "Automated code review agent",
  "version": "2.1.0",
  "source": { "type": "github", "repo": "acme/code-review-plugin", "ref": "v2.1.0" }
}
```

The `version` field is informational (displayed by `apm view` and `apm outdated`). The `source.ref` determines which Git ref APM checks out during install.

## Register a marketplace

```bash
apm marketplace add acme/plugin-marketplace
```

This registers the marketplace and fetches its `marketplace.json`. By default APM tracks the `main` branch.

### Default alias resolution

When `--name` is not provided, APM resolves the local alias in this order:

1. `name` field declared in the marketplace's `marketplace.json` (if present and valid)
2. Repository name (fallback)

This ensures parity with Claude Code install instructions -- if a marketplace's `marketplace.json` declares `"name": "addy-agent-skills"`, APM registers it under that alias and shows a hint:

```
[*] Registering marketplace 'addy-agent-skills'...
[+] Marketplace 'addy-agent-skills' registered (1 plugins)
[i] Install plugins with: apm install <plugin>@addy-agent-skills
```

Use `--name` to override the alias explicitly.

**Options:**
- `--name/-n` -- Override the local alias (defaults to the `marketplace.json` `name` field, then repo name)
- `--branch/-b` -- Branch to track (default: `main`)
- `--host` -- Git host FQDN for non-github.com hosts (default: `github.com` or `GITHUB_HOST` env var)

```bash
# Register with a custom name on a specific branch
apm marketplace add acme/plugin-marketplace --name acme-plugins --branch release

# Register from a GitHub Enterprise host (two equivalent forms)
apm marketplace add acme/plugin-marketplace --host ghes.corp.example.com
apm marketplace add ghes.corp.example.com/acme/plugin-marketplace
```

## List registered marketplaces

```bash
apm marketplace list
```

Shows all registered marketplaces with their source repository and branch.

## Browse plugins

View all plugins available in a specific marketplace:

```bash
apm marketplace browse acme-plugins
```

## Search a marketplace

Search plugins by name or description in a specific marketplace using `QUERY@MARKETPLACE`:

```bash
apm search "code review@skills"
```

**Options:**
- `--limit` -- Maximum results to return (default: 20)

```bash
apm search "linting@awesome-copilot" --limit 5
```

The `@MARKETPLACE` scope is required -- this avoids name collisions when different
marketplaces contain plugins with the same name. To see everything in a marketplace,
use `apm marketplace browse <name>` instead.

## Install from a marketplace

Use the `NAME@MARKETPLACE` syntax to install a plugin from a specific marketplace:

```bash
# Install using the source ref from the marketplace entry
apm install code-review@acme-plugins

# Install with a specific git ref override
apm install code-review@acme-plugins#v2.0.0

# Install from a specific branch
apm install code-review@acme-plugins#main
```

The `#` separator carries a raw git ref that overrides the `source.ref` from the marketplace entry. Without `#`, APM uses the ref defined in the marketplace manifest.

APM resolves the plugin name against the marketplace index, fetches the underlying Git repository using the resolved ref, and installs it as a standard APM dependency. The resolved source appears in `apm.yml` and `apm.lock.yaml` just like any direct dependency.

For full `apm install` options, see [CLI Commands](../../reference/cli-commands/).

## View plugin details

Show metadata for a marketplace plugin:

```bash
apm view code-review@acme-plugins
```

Displays the plugin's name, version, description, source, and tags.

## Provenance tracking

Marketplace-resolved plugins are tracked in `apm.lock.yaml` with full provenance:

```yaml
apm_modules:
  acme/code-review-plugin:
    resolved: https://github.com/acme/code-review-plugin#main
    commit: abc123def456789
    discovered_via: acme-plugins
    marketplace_plugin_name: code-review
```

The `discovered_via` field records which marketplace was used for discovery. `marketplace_plugin_name` stores the original plugin name from the index. The `resolved` URL and `commit` pin the exact version, so builds remain reproducible regardless of marketplace availability.

## Cache behavior

APM caches marketplace indexes locally with a 1-hour TTL. Within that window, commands like `search` and `browse` use the cached index. After expiry, APM fetches a fresh copy from the network. If the network request fails, APM falls back to the expired cache (stale-if-error) so commands still work offline.

Force a cache refresh:

```bash
# Refresh a specific marketplace
apm marketplace update acme-plugins

# Refresh all registered marketplaces
apm marketplace update
```

## Registry proxy support

Marketplace commands (`add`, `browse`, `search`, `update`) honor the `PROXY_REGISTRY_URL` and `PROXY_REGISTRY_ONLY` environment variables, fetching `marketplace.json` through the configured proxy with optional GitHub Contents API fallback. See [Registry Proxy & Air-gapped](../../enterprise/registry-proxy/) for full configuration, the bypass-prevention contract, and the air-gapped CI playbook.

## Manage marketplaces

Remove a registered marketplace:

```bash
apm marketplace remove acme-plugins

# Skip confirmation prompt
apm marketplace remove acme-plugins --yes
```

Removing a marketplace does not uninstall plugins previously installed from it. Those plugins remain pinned in `apm.lock.yaml` to their resolved Git sources.

## Validate a marketplace

Check a marketplace manifest for schema errors and duplicate entries:

```bash
apm marketplace validate acme-plugins

# Verbose output
apm marketplace validate acme-plugins --verbose
```

Catches: missing required fields and duplicate plugin names (case-insensitive).

:::note[Planned]
The `--check-refs` flag will verify that source refs are reachable over the network. It is accepted but not yet implemented.
:::

For full option details, see [CLI Commands](../../reference/cli-commands/).

## Security

### Version immutability

APM caches version-to-ref mappings in `~/.apm/cache/marketplace/version-pins.json`. On subsequent installs, APM compares the marketplace ref against the cached pin. If a version's ref has changed, APM warns:

```
WARNING: Version 2.0.0 of code-review@acme-plugins ref changed: was 'v2.0.0', now 'deadbeef'. This may indicate a ref swap attack.
```

This detects marketplace maintainers (or compromised accounts) silently pointing an existing version at different code.

### Shadow detection

When installing a marketplace plugin, APM checks all other registered marketplaces for plugins with the same name. A match produces a warning:

```
WARNING: Plugin 'code-review' also found in marketplace 'other-plugins'. Verify you are installing from the intended source.
```

Shadow detection runs automatically during install -- no configuration required.

### Best practices

- **Use commit SHAs as refs** -- tags and branches can be moved; commit SHAs cannot.
- **Keep plugin names unique across marketplaces** -- avoids shadow warnings and reduces confusion.
- **Review immutability warnings** -- a changed ref for an existing version is a strong signal of tampering.

## Authoring: monorepo workflows

When building a marketplace that tracks packages from a monorepo (multiple packages inside one Git repository), use `--subdir` to point each entry at its subdirectory:

```bash
apm marketplace package add acme/monorepo --subdir plugins/eslint-rules --name eslint-rules
apm marketplace package add acme/monorepo --subdir plugins/formatter --name formatter
```

### Ref auto-resolution

Mutable git refs (`HEAD`, branch names) are automatically resolved to concrete 40-character SHAs before being stored in `apm.yml`. This ensures supply-chain safety -- the entry always pins to an immutable commit.

**Default behaviour (no `--ref`):** When neither `--version` nor `--ref` is provided, the current `HEAD` SHA is pinned automatically:

```bash
# Resolves HEAD to its current SHA and stores it
apm marketplace package add acme/code-review
```

**Explicit `HEAD`:** Passing `--ref HEAD` warns that HEAD is mutable, then resolves:

```bash
apm marketplace package add acme/code-review --ref HEAD
# [!] 'HEAD' is a mutable ref. Resolving to current SHA for safety.
# [i] Resolved HEAD to abc123def456
```

**Branch names:** Branch names that match `refs/heads/*` on the remote are also resolved:

```bash
apm marketplace package add acme/code-review --ref main
# [!] 'main' is a branch (mutable ref). Resolving to current SHA for safety.
# [i] Resolved main to abc123def456
```

**Updating pinned SHAs:** Use `package set` with `--ref HEAD` to re-pin to the latest commit:

```bash
apm marketplace package set code-review --ref HEAD
```

Tags and concrete SHAs are stored as-is without resolution.

:::note
Ref auto-resolution requires network access. When using `--no-verify`, you must provide an explicit SHA with `--ref`.
