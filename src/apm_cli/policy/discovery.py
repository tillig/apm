"""Auto-discover and fetch org-level apm-policy.yml files.

Discovery flow:
1. Extract org from git remote (github.com/contoso/my-project -> "contoso")
2. Fetch <org>/.github/apm-policy.yml via GitHub API (Contents API)
3. Resolve inheritance chain via resolve_policy_chain
4. Cache the **merged effective policy** with chain metadata
5. Parse and return ApmPolicy

Supports:
- GitHub.com and GitHub Enterprise (*.ghe.com)
- Manual override via --policy <path|url>
- Cache with TTL (default 1 hour), stale fallback up to MAX_STALE_TTL
- Atomic cache writes (temp file + os.replace)
- Garbage-response detection (200 OK with non-YAML body)

    merged effective policy with real ``chain_refs``.

    -----

    here.  The env-var check below remains as a defence-in-depth so
