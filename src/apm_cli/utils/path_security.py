"""Centralised path-security helpers for APM CLI.

Every filesystem operation whose target is derived from user-controlled
input (dependency strings, ``virtual_path``, ``apm.yml`` fields) **must**
pass through one of these guards before touching the disk.

Design
------
* ``validate_path_segments`` rejects traversal sequences (``.`` / ``..``)
  at parse time -- before any path is constructed or written.
* ``ensure_path_within`` is the single predicate for filesystem
  containment -- resolves both paths and asserts via
  ``Path.is_relative_to``.
* ``safe_rmtree`` wraps ``robust_rmtree`` with an ``ensure_path_within``
  check so callers get a drop-in replacement.
* ``PathTraversalError`` is a ``ValueError`` subclass for clear error
  semantics and easy ``except`` targeting.

    Normalises backslashes to forward slashes, splits on ``/``, and
    rejects any segment that is ``.`` or ``..``.  Optionally rejects
    empty segments (from ``//`` or trailing ``/``).

    Parameters
    ----------
    path_str : str
        Path-like string to validate (repo URL, virtual path, etc.).
    context : str
        Human-readable label for error messages.
    reject_empty : bool

    allow_current_dir : bool
        If *True*, ``.`` segments are accepted (e.g. for shell command
        strings like ``./bin/my-server`` where "here" is meaningful).
        ``..`` is still rejected.  Defaults to *False* so the strict
        rule applies to the dependency / virtual-path call sites.

    ------
    PathTraversalError
