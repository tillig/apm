"""Shared cleanup helper for stale deployed files.

Used by the post-install cleanup blocks in :mod:`apm_cli.commands.install`
to remove files previously deployed for a still-present package that the
current install no longer produces (e.g. after a rename or removal inside
the package). Centralises the safety gates so both the local-package and
remote-package cleanup paths apply the same rules.

Safety gates, in order:

1. **Path validation** -- :meth:`BaseIntegrator.validate_deploy_path` rejects
   path traversal and any path not under a known integration prefix.
2. **Directory rejection** -- APM-managed primitives are file-keyed
   (``SKILL.md`` for skills, individual ``.prompt.md`` / ``.instructions.md``
   files elsewhere). A ``deployed_files`` entry that resolves to a directory
   on disk is treated as untrusted (likely a poisoned lockfile entry under a
   broad prefix like ``.github/instructions/``) and refused.
3. **Provenance check** -- when the previous lockfile recorded a content
   hash for the file, the on-disk content must still match. If the user
   edited the file after APM deployed it the hash will differ and the
   deletion is skipped with a warning. Files without a recorded hash
   (legacy lockfiles) fall through and are deleted, preserving prior
   behaviour.

The helper records cleanup diagnostics via *diagnostics* (collect-then-
render) and returns a :class:`CleanupResult` summarizing deleted, failed,
and skipped paths. Callers remain responsible for any informational,
progress, or warning logging based on that result -- the helper itself
takes no logger.

            renames/removals) or :func:`apm_cli.drift.detect_orphans`
            (whole package removed from the manifest).
        project_root: Project root the deletion is scoped within.
        dep_key: Unique key of the package these paths belong to (used
            for diagnostic attribution).
        targets: Resolved target profiles for this install (passed
            through to :meth:`BaseIntegrator.validate_deploy_path`).
        diagnostics: ``DiagnosticCollector`` -- recoverable warnings
            (user-edit skip, unlink failure, refused directory entry)
            are pushed here.
        recorded_hashes: Mapping from rel-path to ``"sha256:<hex>"`` as
            stored on the previous ``LockedDependency``. ``None`` (or
            empty) disables the per-file provenance check entirely --
            preserved for backward compat with pre-hash lockfiles.
        failed_path_retained: When ``True`` (default, intra-package
            stale cleanup) the failure diagnostic tells the user APM
            will retry on the next install -- the caller is expected
            to re-insert ``result.failed`` into the new
            ``deployed_files``. When ``False`` (orphan cleanup) the
            owning package is being removed from the lockfile so a
            failed path cannot be retained; the diagnostic instructs
            the user to remove the file manually instead.

    Returns:
        :class:`CleanupResult` describing what happened. The caller is
        responsible for any post-deletion bookkeeping (extending the
        new ``deployed_files`` list with ``failed`` so they are retried,
        invoking :meth:`BaseIntegrator.cleanup_empty_parents` on
        ``deleted_targets``, calling
        :meth:`InstallLogger.cleanup_skipped_user_edit` for each entry
        in ``skipped_user_edit`` so the inline yellow warning renders,
        and reporting ``deleted`` count to the user via
        :meth:`InstallLogger.stale_cleanup` /
        :meth:`InstallLogger.orphan_cleanup`).
